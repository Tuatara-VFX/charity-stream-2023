To close the year off we decided to do a charity stream like [in 2021](https://github.com/Tuatara-VFX/charity-stream-2021), so we hosted a 3 day stream event on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/tuatara_vfx) to fundraise for [Child's Play](https://childsplaycharity.org/), a charity that improves the lives of children through play.

If you missed our live event don't worry, all the videos will be available on our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBYWsrko742LB8oTLdEHOsg).
